\section{Spatial transcriptomic analysis to study cellular communication}
\label{Sec:2.1_intro}	%CREATE YOUR OWN LABEL.
Most ligand-receptor(L-R) interaction research so far has been relying on the use of fluorescently-conjugated antibody-based methods that are only able to assess protein levels of a few target molecules and results are often based on a small number of cells at a time \cite{moses2022museum, lewis2021spatial}. Whole-transcriptome analysis, especially for methods using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), provides a means towards high-throughput L-R screening assays \cite{browaeys2020nichenet, efremova2020cellphonedb}. However, these transcriptomics-based methods do not assess cellular communication in a tissue context, where interactions happen only between neighbour cells but not between distant cells. Spatial transcriptomics sequencing (ST-seq) overcomes these limitations and enables the study of transcriptome-wide gene expression in undissociated tissue sections, maintaining tissue integrity \cite{salmen2018barcoded}. ST-seq measures spatially  gene expression in the spots printed onto a functional glass slide \cite{salmen2018barcoded}, which captures mRNA released from a tissue section, preserving the cell morphology. Each spot in the ST-seq assay is barcoded so the transcript can be mapped back to the tissue location after sequencing. ST-seq has been applied to study the gene expression landscape of tissues and diseases, such as prostate cancer \cite{berglund2018spatial, ji2020multimodal}, pancreatic cancer \cite{moncada2019integrating}, melanoma \cite{thrane2018spatially}. However, ST-seq still has not achieved single-cell resolution per spatial spot (1-50 cells/spot), and the number of cells and the transcriptome quality can be captured in each spot depending on the tissue context. These shortcomings of ST-seq can be overcome by a targeted RNA \textit{in situ} hybridization (RNA-ISH) approach to visualize the possible cell interaction through detecting L-R expression at a single cell level. The RNAscope HiPlex assay (ACD Bio) has been developed based on the RNA-ISH technique and improved signal amplification and background suppression process compared to the previous version, allowing for visualization and detection of mRNA at near single molecule sensitivity \cite{wang2012rnascope,schulz2018simultaneous}. The technology allows researchers to simultaneously detect up to 12 single target genes on the same tissue section through fluorophore cleavage steps.  

In this chapter, I established an analysis pipeline called STRISH to study the L-R interaction of cancer and immune cells across the whole tissue section, utilizing neighbourhood information between cells. The pipeline combines four complementary technologies to study and validate the L-R interaction between immune and cancer cells in skin cancer tissue. Available datasets for developing STRISH were generated by scRNA-seq, ST-seq, and RNAscope for selected L-R pairs. With the complementary features of these three different technologies above, we comprehensively discovered and validated L-R interaction at the transcriptional level. To identify L-R pairs at a transcriptome-wide scale, we first applied two RNA sequencing approaches, starting with scRNA-seq and followed by ST-seq, using skin cancer samples. We hypothesised that current computational methods that only use gene expression levels of cells to infer interactions (scRNA-seq) without spatial information would result in false positive detection of interactions between cells that are further away. 

On the other hand, spatial data could reduce false detection by adding spatial information from ST-seq data and multiplexed FISH. We also posited that most ligands and receptors are expressed at a relatively low level, leading to a high possibility for the under-detection of those genes by using either scRNA-seq or ST-seq, but not RNAscope or digital droplet PCR. Therefore, the overarching goal of this chapter was to detect interactions by making use of the complementarity of these transcriptomic technologies to build a comprehensive toolbox consisting of less sensitive methods but at a broader genome-wide scale with scRNA-seq and ST-seq to the more sensitive technology but at a small set of targeted genes or proteins with RNAscope (RNA level) (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1}A).

To achieve this aim, we performed an in-depth analysis of two of the most common skin cancer types (Basal Cell Carcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma - BCC, SCC), where we used a reference baseline with a set of three known L-R pairs reported to be active immune-cancer interactions in skin cancer with the ground-truth expectation that the pipeline will detect these pairs \ref{table:patientInfor}. These pairs include interleukin-34 (IL34) interacting with colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) \cite{lin2008discovery};  THY1 (also known as CD90), Integrin subunit alpha M (ITGAM, also known as CD11b \cite{wetzel2004human}. As part of the L-R pair selection, these two pairs were assessed using a public database of L-R interaction STRING. Both L-R pairs have strong evidence of interactions (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure1}A-C) \cite{jensen2009string}. 

We assessed how scRNA-seq and ST-seq could detect many L-R pairs and if these pairs include the three reference pairs. We then evaluated the detection of these pairs by the high-sensitive RNAscope and Polaris methods (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1}A). Additionally, we performed digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) to confirm the target gene expression captured from RNAscope. Our STRISH development provided an important assessment of the genomics and imaging technologies that can be used to discover, validate and understand immune-cancer cell interaction within a tumour section, commonly used in histopathological assessment of cancer. The result from this chapter contributed to a paper published in Frontier Immunology.

\section{Methods}
\label{Sec:Methods}
\subsection{Inferring cell-cell interaction through ligand-receptor pairs from scRNA-seq data}
We performed scRNA-seq analysis from the cells dissociated from three tissue samples (Table \ref{table:patientInfor}). scRNA-seq measures the expression of all genes and data can be used for genome-wide prediction of cell-cell interaction (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1}). Freshly shaved suspected SCC and BCC lesions and a 4mm punch biopsy of non-sun exposed skin (Normal B18 ) from the same patient were collected for immediate tissue dissociation (Table \ref{table:patientInfor}). The 10x Genomics Chromium scRNA-sequencing followed the manufacturer’s instructions, using the Single Cell 3’ Library, Gel Bead and Multiplex Kit (version 2, PN-120233; 10x Genomics). Cell numbers in each reaction were optimized to capture approximately 3,000 cells. The single-cell transcriptome libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 machine. The BCL file was converted to a FASTQ file using bcl2fastq/2.17. We used CellRanger/3.0.2 for mapping to Homo sapiens. GRCh38p10 reference. 

We performed scRNA-seq data quality control following Seurat pipeline. All three gene-barcode count matrices were loaded and merged into a single SeuratObject using Seurat/4.0.0 in R/4.0. We removed cells with fewer than 200 or more than 5000 genes and cells with over 20\% of all reads mapped to mitochondrial genes. Seurat canonical correlation analysis was performed to correct the batch effect and integrate the samples. The processed expression matrix was scaled to 10,000 reads per cell and normalized, and only the top 5000 most variable genes were kept for PCA dimensionality reduction. The top 50 PCs were used to generate the UMAP plot and cluster the cells using Louvain graph-based in Seurat (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure2}B). Using FindClusters function with a resolution of 0.7, we determined 12 subpopulations of cell types. Finally, cell type annotation was carried out by differential expression (DE) comparison of each individual cluster against the remaining clusters. DE analysis was performed to find the top 100 differentially expressed genes for each cluster. Clusters with similar top DE genes were combined, which subsequently resulted in 3 different Keratinocytes subtypes, including KC Basal (KRT15, KRT14, CXCL14  upregulated), KC Differentiating (KRT1, 2 and 10), KC Cycle (TOP2A, STMN1)  \cite{joost2016single, ji2020multimodal} and 2 skin specific cell types Melanocyte (DCT, TYR, TYRP1), Pilosebaceous (DEFB1, DEFB2) \cite{belote2021human}. Besides, we identified three immune cell types that are commonly found in skin tissue  Lymphocyte (CD8, CD4), Myeloid (highly expressed CD207, S100A9 and HLA-DRA), Plasma Dendritic cells (CD20, CD79 upregulated) \cite{ji2020multimodal}.          

To infer cell-cell interaction through L-R pair, we applied NicheNet L-R prediction pipeline \cite{browaeys2020nichenet} on our scRNA-seq datasets of cancer and normal samples from a patient ID B18 (Table \ref{table:patientInfor}). We ran the gene differential expression analysis for two conditions, cancer and normal, to identify the genes that differentiate the two conditions. Using deferentially expressed genes, we determined the top 12 upstream ligands and then filtered the prebuilt L-R network to find the corresponding upstream receptor.

\subsection{Visium spatial transcriptomics sequencing and spatially resolved cell-cell interaction analysis}
We performed ST-seq on four tissue sections from three BCC/SCC patients (patient ID-E15, B18, F21) \ref{table:patientInfor}. Four cryosectioned tissues at $10\mu m$ thickness were transferred to chilled Visium Tissue Optimization Slides and Visium Spatial Gene Expression Slides and allowed to adhere by warming the back of the slide. RNAs extracted from the Visium were sequenced following the manufacturer’s instructions. Next, the Visium raw sequencing data in BCL format was converted to 110,782,035 FASTQ reads using bcl2fastq/2.17. The reads were trimmed by cutadapt/1.8.3 to remove sequences from poly-A tails and template-switching oligos. We used SpaceRanger to map FASTQ reads to the cellRanger human reference genome and gene annotation for GRCh38-3.0.0. On average, we mapped 94,700 reads for each spot and detected 1,428 genes. The count matrix of each Visium data was preprocessed to remove genes expressed in less than three cells, followed by the normalization, log transformation and scaling. For spot clustering, we first performed gene expression normalization using spatial morphological information from the H\&E image then clustered the spots using the Louvain community detection algorithm \cite{pham2020stlearn}. The normalization was to reduce the technical limitation in detecting lowly expressed genes. Besides, a neighbourhood graph of spots was built based on the reduced dimensional space, followed by the application of Louvain community detection to similar groups of spots into clusters. 

Regarding cell-cell interaction from ST-seq, we performed the prediction by querying the pair IL34 and CSF1R using the CellPhoneDB, Nichenet and stLearn packages \cite{pham2020stlearn, efremova2020cellphonedb, browaeys2020nichenet} (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}A-C, \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure3}-\ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure4}). For L-R prediction with CellPhoneDB, we applied the default parameters \cite{browaeys2020nichenet, efremova2020cellphonedb} and used a curated database v2.0.0. Additionally, similar to the scRNA-seq analysis for cell-cell communication via L-R pairs, we applied NicheNet L-R prediction on ST-seq data. The upstream ligands were ranked by descending Pearson values, and the top 5 ligands were pulled out to sort out the corresponding upstream receptors (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}G).  

\subsection{Multiplexed RNA \textit{in situ} hybridization with RNAscope}
Following the whole spatially resolved transcriptome experiment, we performed a targeted capture of transcripts using RNAscope to examine the interaction through the L-R pair. Briefly, 5 tissues with each 10µm thickness tissue slide were sectioned from the optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedded BCC or SCC tissue block was used for the \textit{in situ} hybridisation assay. The consecutive sections of each OCT block were made for the negative control. The slide was stained with a mixture of the 5 probes to allow them to hybridize with RNAs. The negative control slide was stained with RNAscope HiPlex 12 Negative control Probe that was provided in the kit. The images were captured by Axio Z1 slide scanner (Zeiss) with an appropriate adjustment of each fluorescent intensity. The first round of images was performed using 4 filters, including DAPI for nuclei.

The slide was stained with a mixture of the 5 probes to allow them to hybridize with RNAs. The negative control slide was stained with RNAscope HiPlex 12 Negative control Probe that was provided in the kit. The images were captured by Axio Z1 slide scanner (Zeiss) with an appropriate adjustment of each fluorescent intensity. The first round of images was performed using 4 filters, including DAPI for nuclei, Cy3 for THY1, Cy5 for IL34, and Cy7 for CSF1R. For the high resolution of an image, a 40x objective was used, and the Z-stack interval was set up to 1.5µm of depth resulting in 9 Z-slices for each slide. The images were further processed by ZEN software (version 3.2) for manual stitching and adjusting contrast/brightness.

\subsection{STRISH pipeline for cell-cell interaction analysis}
\label{Sec:2.3_validation} 
To automatically uncover the interaction of immune cells and cancerous cells in the whole BCC/SCC tissue sections (Table \ref{table:patientInfor}), we developed an analysis pipeline called STRISH. A standard multiplexing RNAscope which captured the cell nuclei and RNA fluorescence signal in a multidimensional image format is used as the input for the pipeline. First, we utilised stardist \cite{schmidt2018cell} model, and QuPath \cite{bankhead2017qupath} to perform cell detection. After cell segmentation, we applied the preprocessing step to calculate the mean signal values of all 9 of the Z-slices following Equation (1), which aggregates the signal from multiple Z slices into one layer. Noted that during the RNAscope imaging, the slide was scanned using Z-stack interval, which resulted in multiple slices of image. It is possible to carry out cell detection at every Z-slice image. However, stardist has consistently outperformed other models in detecting the overlapped signals from the nucleus \cite{schmidt2018cell}. Thus, it allows us to capture the cell with a single-layer image and avoid computational inefficiency. The cell detection process transforms every cell from the DAPI channel in the image into a polygonal object (a margin for the cell membrane is added to the nuclei boundary). Secondly, the mean intensity of the RNA fluorescence signal within the cell boundary was measured and assigned to the corresponding cell (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure2}A Step 1). After that, STRISH provides a function to convert the whole slide image into a single-cell object called $STRISH\_Object$, which is customised from AnnData \cite{wolf2018scanpy}.

Based on cell segmentation and the count of cells per window, STRISH further splits a window into smaller ones if the window has more cells than required and discards those windows without cells (Step 2). Using the remaining windows, which contain cells expressing L-R, STRISH can perform the co-localization scoring and statistical test to produce a heatmap of the most significant windows in a spatial context (Steps 3 and 4).

\begin{equation}
c_{i} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n_{slides}}(c_{ij})}{n_{slides}}
\label{chap2:eq:01}
\end{equation}
where $c_i$ indicates the DAPI or RNA marker channel and $j$ is an iterator of the Z-slices.

Finally, several data preprocessing functions are available within STRISH to remove the effect of artificially high background from fluorescent intensity (outlier) and cells that are too large or small (false detection). By default, STRISH clips that cell’s marker expressions to 95th percentile of all intensities and remove cells that are too small (less than 5th percentile of all areas). To determine more specific thresholds, STRISH enables several functions for quality control and plotting the marker expression of every cell (\ie Fig \ref{fig:Chap2_figure2}C).

\begin{equation}
    coexpression\_sc_{wi} = \begin{cases}
    \frac{n_{cell\_ligand_{wi}} + n_{cell\_receptor_{wi}} }{n_{total\_cell_{wi}}}&;\text{if $ n_{cell\_ligand_{wi}} \neq 0$ and $n_{cell\_receptor_{wi}} \neq 0$}\\
    0              & ;\text{if $ n_{cell\_ligand_{wi}} = 0$ or $n_{cell\_receptor_{wi}} = 0$}
    \label{chap2:eq:02}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

To quantitatively measure the local co-expression of each window, we defined a scoring function to score the number of cells that express either ligand or receptor in the same window following the Equation \ref{chap2:eq:02}. The co-expression score considers the frequency of the cell that expressed the ligand and receptor residing in each window. Besides, the coexpression score is constrained to the presence of both marker ligand and receptor in the same window, which increases the likelihood of interaction between cells through that pair of L-R (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure2}A Step 3). 
   
The downstream analysis for detecting cell local co-expression by window scanning in STRISH is summarised in Algorithm \ref{Chap2:Alg:01}. More specifically, the STRISH functionality for cell local co-expression was developed to iteratively scan through the image, using a neighbourhood window detection strategy to find the target regions with cells expressing the marker of interest. First, a cell scanning windows process is initiated to cover a broad area of scanning with dimensions for width and height set to a predefined rate of the whole scan images. While iterating through the stack of all the existing windows, STRISH will discard those windows with fewer than two cells (cell count is based on DAPI signal). For each window where the number of detected cells is greater than a threshold (user’s defined threshold depending on cancer tissue types), STRISH further splits it into smaller windows (the default rate is 50\% of the current considering window dimension) and adds these smaller windows into the iteration stack (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure2}A Step 2). Finally, windows that pass the cell threshold check are subjected to the next step to detect co-expression. Using the expression level of each marker for every cell as the features, STRISH performs cell classification through standard single-cell cell clustering (\ie Leiden clustering from scanpy \cite{wolf2018scanpy}) and/or signal gating on respective marker signal.

To quantitatively measure the local co-expression of each window, we defined a scoring function to score the number of cells that express either ligand or receptor in the same window following the Equation \ref{chap2:eq:02}. The co-expression score considers the frequency of the cell that expresses the ligand and receptor residing in each window. Besides, the coexpression score is constrained to the presence of both marker ligand and receptor in the same window, which increases the likelihood of interaction between cells through that pair of L-R (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure2}A Step 3). Once every window is scored, a statistical test for the most significant windows is used.

\subsection{Statistical test for tissue regions with significant L-R colocalization}
To validate the test for the significance of the cell-cell interactions based on colocalization scored among all the positive windows, STRISH performs the statistical test to compare the level of co-localisation of the pair of L-R of interest with the random combination of two pairs of markers available for the same window and across all the positive windows. Briefly, STRISH finds tissue locations (windows) that have coexpression of L-R pairs higher than random expression in other windows and by other non-L-R pairs. There are two randomization procedures, testing for the expression level relative to random non-L-R pair at one location (one window) and testing for significant expression of one of co-localisation of L-R pair relative to all locations a window (equation \ref{chap2:eq:03}). Firstly, the means of cell co-localisation for both ligand or receptor within every window $w_i \neq 0$ is compared to the random combination of two positive ligands and a target non-receptor marker from the same window. The comparison between real pairs of L-R cell co-localisation with the matched randomized pairs allows us to show a test for if there is a significantly more abundant presence of the cells expressing  the ligand and receptor within a window than cells co-expressing random pairs. Secondly, for all the windows that have the positive mean of the co-localisation score of the same L-R, we tested if certain windows were tested against each other to identify the significantly more cells co-expressing the pair than the remaining  most significant windows across the tissue. This test reduces false positive detection because while the scanning windows approach could capture the region of colocalisation of cells expressing the ligand and receptor, the colocalisation can be a random expression of the pairs that happened to be in the same window but were at a low level of cells can also be at random. The second randomness test aims to identify the windows which have the highest frequency of colocalisation of the target L-R compared with all other windows throughout the tissue. The combination of two statistical tests generates will provide a P value for each window which corresponds to either significant or insignificant colocalisation. We developed a Python-based pipeline to construct the heatmap of cell local co-expression from the final p-value of the significant windows. 
\begin{equation}
    P_{wi} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(coexpres\_sc_{wi} > coexpres\_sc_{random\_pairs_{wi}})+ \sum_{j=1}^{n-1}(coexpres\_sc_{wi} > coexpres\_sc_{pos\_lr_j}) }{total\_random_{random\_pairs} + total\_window_{pos\_lr}}
    \label{chap2:eq:03}
\end{equation}
Where,	$coexpres\_sc_{wi}$  is the colocalisation score of each window $w_i$, calculated as in Equation \ref{chap2:eq:02}, ($m$ is the number of windows in the dataset); $coexpres\_sc_{random\_pairs_w}$ is the colocalisation score of the same window $w_i$, calculated for random pairs of other markers in the dataset that are known to not interact, as calculated in Equation \ref{chap2:eq:02}; the number of random pairs is the permutation of $\frac{(n*(n-1))}{2}$ (where n is the number of markers in the dataset); $coexpres
\_sc_{pos\_lr_j}$is the colocalisation scores of all the windows within the tissue that express the same ligand and receptor pair as in $w_i$; $total\_random_{random\_pairs}$ denotes the total number of windows with randomized pairs of markers; $total\_window_{pos\_lr}$  denotes the number of windows with the same pair of target ligand-receptor

As there were two rounds of RNAscope imaging, we added to STRISH an image registration functionality. For the interaction of ITGAM and THY1, as the signals of the genes were captured in two separated imaging rounds with the respective stitching in post-process, some variants were introduced (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure7}A-B). To overcome the unaligned tissue layout, we performed image registration to map one image to the other (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure7}C). The image registration is performed solely using SITK library \cite{lowekamp2013design, yaniv2018simpleitk}.

Our code for detecting local co-expression of L-R pairs, generation of the heatmap (interaction activity map), and tissue plotting with contour marking tissue boundary are publicly available on GitHub and STRISH package is available on PyPi. 

% \subsection{Extending STRISH for analysis of Vectra Polaris mutiplex protein data}
% In addition to the analyses at transcriptomic level (RNAscope data), we also extended STRISH’s applications to quantify the interaction between cells at protein level. We reasoned that the STRISH pipeline is computationally flexible and could be applied to construct the landscape of L-R interaction at protein level. Similarly, the analysis on RNAscope, STRISH first performed cell detection by applying positive cell detection on the image that was generated from the Vectra Polaris system. Subsequently, the pipeline applied the PD-1 and PD-L1 markers detection and thresholding to the windows containing fewer than 100 cells. Finally, the STRISH min-max normalization was performed and a heatmap was plotted to display the local co-expression levels of PD-1 and PD-L1.

Unsupervised clustering and differential expression analysis revealed 3 major subpopulations of epithelial (accounted for 80\% of the total cell population), including Keratinocyte (KC) Basal, KC Differentiating (KC-Diff) and KC Cycling (Methods, Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure2}). Several immune and skin-specific cell types were also identified, including Lymphocyte, Myeloid, Dendritic, and Melanocyte (\ref{Sec:Methods}, Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure2}). To infer potential L-R pairs that are likely used as means of intercellular communication, we applied common single-cell inference methods, CellPhoneDB \cite{efremova2020cellphonedb} and NicheNet pipeline \cite{browaeys2020nichenet} on our scRNA-seq dataset of matched samples, containing a squamous cell carcinoma sample tissue (SCC)  and a normal sample tissue from the same patient (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure2}A). NicheNet combines expression data with prior knowledge of gene signalling and gene regulatory networks to predict L-R pairs used by interacting cells (sender and receiver cells).  Using NicheNet differential expression analysis, we identified the list of genes associated with the L-R signalling and plotted the heatmap of potential interaction in  Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure2}A. We expected to use the detection of known IL34-CSF1R \cite{lin2008discovery} and THY1-ITGAM \cite{wetzel2004human} interaction to assess the sensitivity of the inference approach using scRNA-seq. The two pairs were not among the significantly detected pairs predicted by NicheNet (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure2}A). To examine the relatedness of cells coexpressing the L-R pairs, we visualise L-R expression relative to cell cluster information in the UMAP space (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure2}B-C). We found evidence of KC-Basal and KC-Diff cells that expressed IL34 while the receptor CSF1R was expressed by Myeloid and Lymphocyte (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure2}C). However, THY1 and ITGAM were only expressed by a few cells with no distinct patterns of coexpression (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure2}C). The results from examining THY1-ITGAM suggested the insensitivity of using scRNA-seq alone to study cell communication. Overall, we found that scRNA-seq can be utilized to study cell communication, but statistical test based on gene expression alone has low sensitivity and mis-detects expected interactions.  

\subsection{Genome-wide analysis of ligand-receptor interaction using ST-seq}

We postulated that cell-cell communication could be more accurately assessed by using ST-seq, which preserves neighbourhood information of interacting cells. We performed ST-seq on four tissue sections from four patients, with 2xSCC and 2xBCC tissue sections, (Table \ref{table:patientInfor}), (Figures \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}C, \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}E, \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure3}A, \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure4}A-C, \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}A).  With ST-seq protocol, hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) image allowed us to annotate cancer and immune cells, where the morphology revealed important tissue regions, including cancer nests, immune infiltration and non-cancer regions (Figures \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure4}A-C,\ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}A ). Additionally, adjacent tissue sections were used for RNAscope analysis as a means of validation (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}A, \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}B;  Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure5}).  From the same block, one section was used for ST-seq and another for RNAscope and comparing the ST-seq and RNAscope results for the two sections allows us to validate the ST-seq prediction data (Figures \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure3}, \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure4}), as discussed in the later section.

With ST-seq approach, we reasoned that because each spot in the Visium slide contains a mixture of cells and these neighbouring cells (within a 55 $\mu$m diameter spot) can communicate if both ligand and receptor are detected in the spot (juxtacrine, autocrine, and short distance paracrine interactions). In addition, the interaction between cells from two neighbouring spots (100 $\mu$m distance), through paracrine signalling, can likely occur if these spots display L-R co-expression. Therefore, local co-expression of L-R pairs within a spot or between neighbouring spots in ST-seq data suggests possible cell-cell interaction. Based on the above assumptions, we implemented stLearn cell-cell interaction analysis to test for L-R local co-expression that was significantly higher than the background signal of random non-interacting gene-gene pairs. Using our stLearn software, we generated a cell-cell communication activity map across each of the whole tissue section for IL34-CSF1R from ST-seq data (Figures \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure3}A-B, \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure4}, \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}A-C) \cite{pham2020stlearn}. Specifically, the heatmap of significant L-R interaction in the ST-seq data suggests the concentrated regions with high interaction within and surrounding the tumour areas as well as the immune infiltration regions. Independent pathological annotation also provided evidence for IL34-CSF1R interaction at the cancer-immune infiltration regions (Fig \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure3}A-C, \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure4}, \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}A). Additionally, unbiased clustering of gene expression using a graph-based approach in stLearn demarcates the tissue section into four distinct groups (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}E). Based on differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways, we identified two major populations in cluster 1, observed in normal skin, including keratinocyte (expressing CSTA, KRT6A) \cite{finnegan2019single}, the epidermis (expressing KRT10, KRT14) \cite{ji2020multimodal}. Meanwhile the other three clusters expressed markers for cancer (SFRP5, GLI1) \cite{lacour2002carcinogenesis, ji2020multimodal}, stromal cells (CD40, THY1) \cite{koumas2003thy}, and macrophages (CXCL12, CD68). The distribution of the four cell types identified unbiasedly based on molecular profiles consistently overlapped with the pathological annotation based on the skin morphology and cancerous areas defined in H\&E images. These cell types support the ST-seq prediction of spatial locations where IL34-CSF1R interact (between inflammatory cells \cite{lin2019function}. The interaction activities were highest in the area with more cancer and immune infiltration cells, particularly in the epidermal compartment (Figures \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure3}E, \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure4}A-\ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure4}B,\ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}A).

\subsection{Comparisons of ligand-receptor interaction between ST-seq and scRNA-seq}
% ********* Enter your text below this line: ********
We found that computational methods that did not use spatial information failed to detect expected L-R interactions. From the CellPhoneDB analysis pipeline, \cite{efremova2020cellphonedb}, a total of 1024 possible combinations of L-R were tested using the ST-seq dataset. The dot-plot in Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}F demonstrated the low significance of the two L-R pairs, IL34-CSF1R and THY1-amb2 complex (ITGAM pathway) in comparison to the four other CellPhoneDB highest significance of the interaction pairs. We further applied NicheNet \cite{browaeys2020nichenet} workflow on the ST-seq data to integrate prior knowledge into the prediction. While NicheNet could identify interaction pairs that were directly linked to cancer (\ie CD6-ALCAM), the prediction also failed to detect the two pairs IL34-CSF1R and THY1-ITGAM. The expression plots of the four target markers overlayed to the tissue section (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure3}C, \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure3}D) illustrated the low abundance across the tissue, which likely suffered from the inherent dropout (randomly mis-detecting molecules due to the scRNA-seq protocol). The results suggest that for the noisy (high dropout) data and lowly-abundant genes, computational methods without spatial information like CellPhoneDB and NicheNet likely misidentify meaningful cell-cell communication (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}F-G). In contrast, the addition of spatial information to test for significant local-coexpression over the background, like stLearn, could detect such signalling events (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}C; Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure3}E,  \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure4}A-\ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure4}B). Although scRNA-seq and ST-seq enable us to test for thousands of ligand-receptor pairs, their inherent technical limitations in detection sensitivity necessitate the addition of independent validation experiments that are sensitive and are not sequencing-based. Next, we describe RNAscope and our novel Spatial TRanscriptomic \textit{In Situ} Hybridization (STRISH) pipeline as a powerful experimental method for validating cell-cell interaction within spatial tissue sections.

To overcome the limitations in detection sensitivity due to a lack of signal in the cancer region from the sequencing methods (scRNA-seq and ST-seq) and to achieve single-cell resolution, we implemented RNAscope HiPlex assay. RNAscope HiPlex can detect up to 12 gene targets simultaneously at single-molecule sensitivity. In this study, we used whole tissue fluorescent microscopy images captured at 40x magnification to determine RNA interaction at cellular resolution. Three different fluorophores (Cy3, Cy5 and Cy7) were used in two iterative wash-stain rounds to label the five distinct target genes, including THY1, IL34, and CSF1R, CD207 and ITGAM (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}B). The zoom-in images from a cancer nest area (marked as a white dashed line, and two red/green circles - IL34 and CSF1R in a red box and THY1 and ITGAM in a green box) show distinct coexpression of neighbouring cells at single-cell resolution, suggesting cell to cell interaction for each of pair compared to no signal in the 'Negative' control.

STRISH pipeline consists of two phases, starting with a cell local co-expression detection step to define the spatial neighbourhood, followed by scoring, statistical testing and visualizing significant local co-expression (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure2}A; Method Algorithms \ref{Chap2:Alg:01}, \ref{Chap2:Alg:02}). Local co-expression is defined as the expression within a tissue area containing fewer than a threshold number of cells (depending on tissue types), \ie fewer than 100 cells. The pipeline runs a series of positive-cell detection iterations to find regions that contain lower than the predefined threshold of neighbouring cells and subsequently determines the number of L-R co-expression within these regions (refer to the Method section about STRISH algorithm). The L-R co-expression scores are then used for a statistical test of significant coexpression over the null distribution of random, non-interacting gene-gene pairs. Across the tissue samples, we observed considerable interaction of IL34-CSF1R around the areas where the cancer nests are in both BCC and SCC, particularly in the epidermal compartments (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure1_result}E, \ref{fig:Chap2_figure2}B). Interestingly, compared to RNAscope data, we observed a similar pattern in ST-seq data, with many spots that were predicted to have cell-cell communication through IL34-CSF1R located in the cancer and epidermis regions.  

We further assessed the performance of STRISH by measuring the interaction of another less abundant L-R pair, THY1-ITGAM. We found the lower signal and less widespread interaction of THY1-ITGAM that were localized to the dermal compartments (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure2}B). By comparing the number of the tissue regions (through STRISH windows) where local co-expression was found, we noticed the average count of the windows with THY1 and ITGAM co-expression was, on average, 2.5 times less than those of IL34-CSF1R. Similarly, the normalized local co-expression in the same STRISH windows for ITGAM was also lower than that of IL34. We noted that most of the STRISH-detected local co-expression of THY1 and ITGAM were clustered densely around the adjacent areas of the immune cell infiltration. At the core, STRISH is constructed based on a new data structure called $STRISH\_Object$, which encapsulates the data structure from AnnData \cite{wolf2018scanpy}. Thus, STRISH is highly compatible with other single-cell platforms (\ie Scanpy \cite{wolf2018scanpy}, and Squidpy \cite{palla2022squidpy}). STRISH can also accommodate the visualization of the expression level of each marker at single-cell for quality inspection and facilitate the external validation/correlation of cell positive with markers of interest (\ie ddPCR) (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure2}C). We also found that STRISH was quantitative and provided the capability of counting interaction events, an important utility that is needed in cellular communication research (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure2}D; Equation \ref{chap2:eq:02}, \ref{chap2:eq:03}). Overall, we found that RNAscope data analysed by STRISH could detect cell-cell communications at a higher sensitivity than ST-seq and scRNA-seq. 

\subsection{Highly sensitive detection of ligand and receptor expression by ddPCR}
While RNAscope is expected to be able to detect single molecules in each cell, scanning through a whole tissue section with millions of cells may lead to noise and reduced accuracy due to tissue heterogeneity. ddPCR, on the other hand, enables sensitively detecting and quantifying single molecules from tissues, albeit spatial information is absent. To further confirm the presence of ligands and receptors in the tissue, we performed ddPCR on the same cancer tissue block (Figure  \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure6}). The transcript copy number per input RNA of each gene was presented in a bar plot (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_Supfigure2}E). ddPCR signal was highly consistent between cells (droplets), and both L-R pairs were detected. Strikingly, the result from ddPCR was highly consistent with that of RNAscope data (Figure \ref{fig:Chap2_figure2}D, \ref{fig:Chap2_figure2}E), with Pearson correlations at 0.95, 0.89 and 0.94 for the patient samples tested, ID-E15, B18 and D04, respectively. The ddPCR results support the quantitativeness of using RNAscope for measuring target gene expression, suggesting the suitability of using RNAscope for detecting and quantifying cell-cell interaction.

\section{Discussion}
We presented a technological and computational end-to-end pipeline from discovery to validation of L-R interaction across the whole spatial landscape of a tumour tissue section using 4 complementary technologies. Multimodal data from these four methods allowed us to systematically examine over 1000 L-R pairs in scRNA-seq and ST-seq data, followed by deep analyses of three L-R pairs for patients with two types of non-melanoma skin cancers (BCC and SCC), which account for about 70\% of all cancer cases \cite{garcovich2017skin}. The pipeline allows us to quantitatively and visually assess the expression of target transcripts while maintaining the physiological spatial information in undissociated tissue sections. Computationally, we developed and demonstrated the utility of an imaging analysis pipeline called STRISH to automatically and statistically detect tissue regions with high cell-to-cell interaction activities, from high multiplex RNAscope RNA and Opal protein imaging data. STRISH imaging analysis results are important orthogonal validation of the predictive results from scRNA-seq and ST-seq analysis.  

For quantitative cell-cell interaction analysis, STRISH automatically scans for local co-expression of a pair of L-R genes or proteins in an RNAscope image or Opal Polaris image to recapitulate an interaction landscape across the whole tissue section. The pipeline also consists of a robust image registration step to merge two separate images from two imaging rounds, with potential application to also merge histopathological images in adjacent tissue sections. This utility allows for data integration, not only increasing the multiplex capacity to detect more L-R in one tissue section, but also adding the pathological annotation to interpret the molecular analyses. Existing image analysis tools have been developed to search for colocalization of two gene/protein markers within each individual cell \cite{bolte2006guided}. STRISH, in contrast, finds co-expression between neighbouring cells rather than within one cell, thereby identifying potential paracrine interaction between cells that are in proximity to each other. Significant regions can then be visualized in a heatmap covering the whole tissue landscape. Overall, STRISH is generalisable from assessing interactions at RNA levels like IL34-CSF1R and THY1-ITGAM in RNA-ISH multiplex assay to protein level like PD1-PD-L1 in Opal Polaris protein assay. 

Our detection of CSF1R and CSF1/IL34 interaction between cancer and immune infiltrating cells at the epidermal layers was consistent with the biological context of skin cancer. The signalling interaction between CSF1R and CSF1/IL34 is well known to regulate macrophage differentiation \cite{lin2008discovery}. IL34, CSF1 and their receptors co-expressed within the immune cell infiltrated area and regulated the different downstream signalling pathways in breast cancer \cite{zins2018differential}. CSF1R is known to be expressed on CD1a/CD207 Langerhans cells in the human epidermis and stratified epithelial \cite{lonardi2020csf1r}, where it can be found in high abundance in the basal and squamous layers of the epidermis, and is involved in anti-tumoral immune responses \cite{pogorzelska2020density}. Here, we specifically observed that the co-expression of IL34-CSF1R L-R pair is high in/near the cancer nest area in all the patient samples analysed and that the interaction was heterogeneous in high or low activities across the whole tissue section. The results are important in pinpointing the microenvironment within the tissue that can potentially be markers for cancer progression.

Our results suggest RNAscope Hiplex assay is quantitative, sensitive and high-resolution in detecting L-R interactions. RNAscope detection is more suitable than IHC in precancerous dysplastic nodules, helping early monitoring and diagnosis for patients with a high risk of diseases \cite{bakheet2020improving}. Additionally, our results from the absolute quantification of the target genes from ddPCR analysis (using adjacent tissue sections of the same tissue blocks) suggest that the RNAscope can accurately measure the expression of L-R pairs. Moreover, RNAscope can map the interactions across different locations within the tissue. This observation is important because RNAscope assay quantifies from a microscopic image that captures the fluorescent transcripts, which are usually semi-quantitative. The high correlation to ddPCR results suggests the high accuracy of the RNAscope assay. 

Here, we presented a complete pipeline from bench work to bioinformatic analysis to study cell interaction through L-R pairs in cancer tissues. We suggest using spatial transcriptomics (with whole-genome scale and with spatial information, like the Visium), followed by a targeted validation approach that is more sensitive and at a high resolution like the RNAscope and/or with an additional validation at the protein level like by using mIHC (\ie Polaris). The workflow demonstrates the feasibility of discovering new L-R pairs by genome-wide approaches (scRNA-seq and/or ST-seq), which are less sensitive but cover all genes, followed by targeted validation by high-resolution, high-multiplex, and sensitive RNAscope imaging and Opal protein imaging. The results and analyses presented in this chapter have addressed the thesis's first aim, which is to develop a novel computational analysis to locate the cell-cell interaction through L-R pair in spatial transcriptomic data.  The analytical platform that allows for the discovery and detailed analyses of more than one pair of L-R interactions in cancer tissues provides a powerful approach to finding new targets and/or understanding the mechanisms underlying options for combinatorial immunotherapies. 

So far, the analysis result presented in this chapter suggests the approach to screen for the potential L-R pair using complementary spatial transcriptomic approaches.  However, cancer is known for its heterogeneity and tumours can separate the tissue into multiple compartments. Knowledge of the spatial distribution of cells and proteins within the tissue is essential for the complete understanding of cell biology. Besides, not all transcripts will translate into proteins and the availability of technologies for spatial proteomic is also more accessible. Therefore, Chapter 3 will demonstrate a series of spatial analyses to study the cancer microenvironment and the structure of cell organisation in cancer tissues.  Particularly, Chapter 3 will discuss the analysis results conducted by spatial proteomic data to identify the spatial distribution of cell community and the heterogeneity of cell phenotype across the samples.
