[Microenvironmental regulation of tumour progression and metastasis ] 
While it is generally agreed that chronic inflammation caused by immune response is a pro-tumorigenesis incident. It is also critical to note that impaired immune responses can correlate with high cancer incidence. In a statistical analysis of up to 26,000 female patients receiving the immunosuppressant post-organ transplant, the tumour incidence was higher than predicted for multiple cancers, including lung, gastrointestinal, reproductive and skin cancers \cite{stewart1995incidence}. In contrast, breast cancer incidence decreased in this cohort, illustrating the paradoxical nature of immune responses.   Similar retrospective analyses in immunodeficiency syndrome patients have also indicated that adequate immune function may be protective against certain cancers \cite{quail2013microenvironmental}.  

Furthermore, an analysis of 122,993 individuals with AIDS revealed elevated incidence of not only AIDS-related cancers (for example, Kaposi's sarcoma) but also nonâ€“AIDS-related cancers (for example, cancers of the tongue, skin, lung or central nervous system and multiple myeloma)18. Similar retrospective analyses
